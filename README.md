# 3D Platformer Built with Primitive Objects in Unity. 

A minimalist 3D Platformer prototype built entirely using **Unity primitives** â€” no imported assets.  
Created to demonstrate how core **game mechanics and systems** can be prototyped without finalized visuals.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay

You play as a blue ball trying to dodge environmental hazards and enemies that chase you.
Colliding with certain obstacles will end the game, while others will launch you backward with significant force.
The game ends when you successfully reach the end of the level and collide with a pretty ball waiting there.
Controls: WASD and Space bar

## ðŸ›  Built With

- Unity **6000.1.3f1**
- C#

This was my **first solo game project**, made **without any major external help**. The visuals are basic and built entirely from Unity's primitive shapes (spheres, cubes, etc.), but the project demonstrates my grasp of **game development concepts** such as:

- Player control and input handling  
- Physics interactions  
- Object spawning and destruction  
- Basic win/loss conditions
